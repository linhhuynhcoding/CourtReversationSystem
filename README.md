# The pickleball court reservation system

The pickleball court reservation system for a sports center can be expanded to manage the sale of sports equipment, snacks, and beverages. This system not only facilitates easy court bookings for players but also provides an integrated shopping experience, catering to the diverse needs of customers.

The mobile application or web interface will allow players not only to reserve courts but also to explore and purchase available products, order food and drinks before arriving at the courts. The system will also integrate AI to forecast weather conditions, helping users to keep track of weather and adjust their court bookings flexibly.

Additionally, the system can provide information and product suggestions based on weather conditions, such as what attire to bring or which beverages to purchase for hydration, enhancing players' overall experience.
